# GEEHP - Geostatistical Enhancement of European Hydrological Predictions

This repository is a collection of R files built for the GEEHP experiment. 
In order to use the script "GEEHP_overlapping_areas_EHYPE_obs.R", please make sure to download the file "distance_matrix.csv" and put it in your working directory.  

I reccomend reading this post on RPubs <http://www.rpubs.com/alessio-pugliese/259322>, this is an experiment report showing how to use all the single files and where to get input data.
